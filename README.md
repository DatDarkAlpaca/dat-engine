# Dat Engine
As the description clearly states, this is a toy engine. It is not meant to be used as a commercial game engine substitute, nor it has - or will ever have - the capacity to do so. 

# Getting Started

As of the current version, DatEngine doesn't support any form of project generation. As soon as I figure out how to set up CMake or Premake, I'll do so. 
For now, opening the [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/downloads/) solution file will have to suffice.

## Prerequisites

In order to build this project, you'll need to download the following IDE:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/downloads/)

## Downloading

It is fairly easy to download the project, all you need to do is to [clone](https://github.com/DatDarkAlpaca/dat-engine/) it from
GitHub. There is also the option to [download](https://github.com/DatDarkAlpaca/dat-engine/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
a copy of the repository.

If you want to clone the repository using the terminal instead, use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DatDarkAlpaca/dat-engine/
```

## Building the project

To build the project, click `Build` then `Build Solution` on Visual Studio. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
The executable files are generated under `bin/Configuration/Platform`, and the intermediate files are generated under `intermediate/Configuration/Platform`.
